            Hello world! How are you on this beautiful day? Another day alive, another day to cherish, another day to remember. Another day to spend with your loved ones, to love one another, to love yourself. It's so precious, so rare to love. To truly love. To forget yourself, your ego, and simply be with someone else.
        </p>
