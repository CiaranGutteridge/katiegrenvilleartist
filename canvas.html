        <p>"Cowboys Don't Last Long" is a painting inspired by iconic American advertising of the 1960’s, Kirsty MacColl, and the artist's personal encounters with somewhat disappointing cowboys.

            This piece is a commentary on the perception of The Cowboy as the peak of "alpha-dog" masculinity - something that the artist subverts here with the camp-ness of these sparking boots and the text that suggest that perhaps encounters with cowboys are ultimately less exciting than they seem. It is a comment on notions of masculinity in popular cinema - specifically the tropes of male protagonists in Westerns - that has a solemn and pessimistic tone. As we know, many of these films often end with the death of the protagonist cowboy figure, bringing a double-meaning of the phrase "Cowboys Don't Last Long" that seems to point to the destructive nature of portraying these violent, lawless and lonesome male characters as pinnacles of masculinity.

        <p>"Boys Boys Boys" is a painting depicting Howdy Doodie the, once-beloved, childhood  TV star of the 1950s and '60s. His dead eyes stare out of the canvas through a masculine-reimagining of the familiar seedy nightclub neons that flash: "GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS" to potential customers. Peering through the letters, Doody's enormous scale poses him as a figure of imposing and unnerving authority. The all-American puppet appears in black and white, taking away any chance of appearing to us as a figure of nostalgia. Instead, he seems to be a confused-advertisement, an image of boyhood charm that has grown ugly and uncomfortable with age, an anachronistic reference that serves as a reminder of a past now thought of as, at best, suspicious and, at worst, horrendous.
